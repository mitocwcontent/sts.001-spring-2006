Smith, Merritt Roe, and Gregory Clancey, eds. _Major Problems in the History of American Technology_. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin, 1998. ISBN: 9780669354720.

Students must also read a book selected from a list of acceptable titles, and write a review as described in the [assignments]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/assignments) section.

*   List of acceptable books for review ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/reviewbooks_ocw))

For students who are not familiar with American history and need to familiarize themselves with the subject, a helpful introduction is: Maier, Pauline, et al. _Inventing America: A History of the United States_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: W.W. Norton & Co., 2005. ISBN: 9780393926750.

Films viewed in many class sessions are also listed in the table.
