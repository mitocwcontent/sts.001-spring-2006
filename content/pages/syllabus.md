This page presents a course overview, course policies and requirements, and a [class schedule](#calendar).

Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week  
Lec 1: 1 hour / session, Lec 2: 2 hours / session

Class Overview
--------------

This class will consider the ways in which technology, broadly defined, has contributed to the building of American society from colonial times to the present. Far from being an "add-on" to political and social events, technology is viewed as a central organizing theme in American history. Indeed, the United States is often referred to as "the technological society." What does that expression mean? Why did it originate? How and in what ways does technology intersect with society and politics? How has technological progress been construed in America? Does technology mean progress? If so, progress for whom and for what? What is the relationship between technology and democracy in America? How have notions of "responsibility" in engineering and technology development changed over time?

This course has three primary goals: to train students to ask critical questions of both technology and the broader culture of American society; to provide an historical perspective with which to frame and address such questions; and to encourage students to be neither blind critics of new technologies, nor blind advocates for technologies in general, but thoughtful and educated participants in the democratic process.

Requirements
------------

This class meets two times per week: the first session per week is one hour long, while the second session per week lasts two hours. Class meetings will consist of lectures or films, followed by discussion. In each longer class period, two students will lead the discussion of material presented in lecture, film, and readings. In addition to attending all classes, students are expected to participate in these discussions by reading assigned materials **before** class and thinking about the themes, questions, and historical patterns the readings suggest.

Writing Assignments
-------------------

Writing for this course will consist of a 6-7 page book review of a book selected from a list, a 12-page essay on an assigned topic, and a 2-3 page reading response/discussion paper.

**Reading response/discussion paper:** each student will be assigned a date on which he or she is expected to submit a reading response paper and lead discussion in the section. An example response paper will be distributed, to give you an idea of how you are expected to construct your own responses.

All written work must be typed in 12-point font, double-spaced, with adequate margins. All papers must be proofread (not just spell checked) before submission: papers will be downgraded for errors of carelessness. Students who need extra help with writing should visit the Writing Center as they prepare their papers for submission, or schedule an appointment with the class Writing Tutor **two weeks in advance of due dates**. After initial grading, the book review and essay will be revised by students and re-submitted. Improvements will result in higher grades.

Examinations
------------

There is a cumulative final examination for this class, and two short quizzes, covering the readings, lectures, and films. Keep in mind that the lectures and readings for this course usually do not cover the same material. This means that you must be present in class and take good notes in order to be prepared for the quizzes and final exam.

Grading Policy
--------------

Final grades will be determined as follows:

| Activities | Percentages |
| --- | --- |
| Book Review | 20% |
| Essay | 25% |
| Reading Response Paper/Discussion Leading | 10% |
| Quizzes | 20% |
| Final Exam | 25% 

Regular attendance, participation, and a good attitude are essential. Without all three you will not get much out of this course. **Attendance will be taken daily and poor attendance will result in severe final grade penalties. Each student is allowed no more than two (2) unexcused absences**. Thereafter one's final grade will be reduced by one full grade per cut. If a situation arises during the term (illness, family emergency, etc.) and you have to miss classes, please be sure to notify the instructor.

Readings and Films
